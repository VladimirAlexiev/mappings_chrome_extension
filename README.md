mappings_chrome_extension
=========================

A chrome extension for generating new mappings
 
 
Install it from chrome://extensions (first enable the "Developer mode" and then "Load unpacked extension") and point to the extension folder.

To test it go to http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/statistics/en/?show=100000 (or any other language), find an uncreated infobox (red/grey) and click edit. Once you create the page, the extension will fill the edit text with basic data coming from template statistics.
